tldr:
- 'Problem: practical constraints in RF localization / sensing degrade robustness.'
- 'Key idea: design estimation and calibration strategy tailored to the deployment
  setup.'
- 'Result: reported in IEEE AP-S/URSI 2024 (Florence) (2024).'
method_steps:
- Define measurement/model assumptions for the target scenario.
- Estimate or calibrate key parameters with robust objective design.
- Validate on experimental/benchmark setup and compare against baselines.
results:
- Core metric improvements are summarized in the paper and figures.
- Robustness under practical constraints is analyzed with ablations or comparative
  tests.
